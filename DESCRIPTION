Description: Fits predictive and symmetric co-correspondence analysis (CoCA) models to relate one data matrix
  to another data matrix. More specifically, CoCA maximises the weighted covariance 
  between the weighted averaged species scores of one community and the weighted averaged species
  scores of another community. CoCA attempts to find patterns that are common to both communitities.
