Cocorresp Change Log

Version 0.1-7 (opened June 25th 2008)

	* permutest.coca: Correct markup for S3 method now
	that permutest is generic in vegan.

	* pasteCall: This function was added to vegan as a
	helper. As cocorresp depends on vegan there is no
	need for it in cocorresp.
	
Version 0.1-6

   * Removed Encoding: UTF-8 from package DESCRIPTION file.
   
   * Fixed a bug in print method for fitted.predcoca
   
   * Added scaleLin and mcLin to internal functions.
   
   * Updated Version: field in DESCRIPTION to match new
     requirements in R 2.6.0.

Version 0.1-5

   * Added 'stats' and 'graphics' to Depends field.

Version 0.1-4

   * Completely rewrote plot.predcoca() and plot.symcoca()
     from the ground up. These methods are far more
     flexible and modular than before and most options are 
     user-configurable. Methods default to a 1x2 display
     showing both biplots, setting 'oneFig = FALSE' overides
     this behaviour and each biplot is plotted in turn on
     the active device. New argument 'ask' controls whether
     the user is prompted to display the next plot or not
     like plot.lm() does. 'ask' tries to work out whether 
     prompting is required (it is not if the user has already 
     set up a 1x2 or greater plotting region). This feature is
     based on code in plot.lm().
  
     Still need to work out the most intuitive way of 
     handlings set of graphical parameters for the 
     predictor and response for total customisation.
  
   * Minor documentation fix

Version 0.1-3

	* scores.symcoca() incorrectly returned the wrong site
	scores for matrix X. Reported by S. Juggins.
	
	* corAxis.symcoca() incorrectly called scores with 
	argument ''extract'' instead of ''display''. Reported 
	by S. Juggins.
	
	* Added flush.console() calls to crossval() and
	permutest.coca() to make sure the progress is
	printed to the console in Mac OSx and Windows. Suggested
	by S. Juggins.
	
	* Added argument n.axes to permutest.coca to control the
	number of axes tested. Defaults to x$n.axes to maintain
	backwards compatibility. Suggested by S. Juggins.
	
	* Minor typos in documentation fixed, and removed 
	\dQuote{} from within \code{} chunks as it was not being
	processed as I expected.

Version 0.1-2

	* First Public Release
